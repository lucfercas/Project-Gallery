            <h1>Hobby Page</h1>
            <p class="description">In this first project, I briefly introduce the concept of design revolving around
                plants, some uses and benefits as a practice. Here I began to write code from scratch, learning about
                html, css and writing my very first lines of javascript (yay!). </p>

            <h1>Movie Data</h1>
            <p class="description">Who doesn’t love Wes Anderson’s movies? This page displays the film’s data, depending
                on its titles, and lets the user arrange the films based on different parameters. This project took me
                the longest to elaborate, but taught me the most. Particularly because I was stubborn enough to want to
                use as much javascript as possible: elaborated functions, loops, object creation and manipulation…etc.

            <h1>Application Website</h1>
            <p class="description">This (my very first coded website) has been so much fun! I tried to create a custom
                appearance while keeping it minimalistic. Here you can read more about me, and my reasons to join FAC.
                In this project I tried to further expand my knowledge of CSS and put some javascript concept previously
                learned to work.</p>

            <h1>Memory card game</h1>
            <p class="description">For this project I wanted to recreate a classic, a memory card game. In this version
                the user must pair all cards for the game end. Each time the cards are shuffled randomly. By discovering
                the mechanics of this game I have learnt how to better use functions and to implement them using maths
                for operations.</p>
